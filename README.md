# The Cruise
## Vehicle Maintenance Tracking App

With Cruise, you'll never forget to maintain your cars. Built from the ground up for the DIY auto enthusiast to the casual commuter, Cruise allows you to keep track of maintenance tasks with reminders and details. When you've finished a task, mark it as complete to have it archived away with all of the maintenance you've performed on your vehicle. This early prototype provides keeping track of vehicles and maintenance items. All of your information is stored in our secure cloud-based system so that you can log into your Cruise account from any Android device.
