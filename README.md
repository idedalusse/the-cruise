# The Cruise
## Vehicle Maintenance Tracking App

With Cruise, you'll never forget to maintain your cars. Built from the ground up for the DIY auto enthusiast to the casual commuter, Cruise allows you to keep track of maintenance tasks with reminders and details. When you've finished a task, mark it as complete to have it archived away with all of the maintenance you've performed on your vehicle. This early prototype provides keeping track of vehicles and maintenance items. All of your information is stored in our secure cloud-based system so that you can log into your Cruise account from any Android device. 

## Current Features
- User accounts with cloud storage
- Vehicle information tracking with photos 
- Maintenance information tracking with due date reminders
- Current vehicle year/make/model information


## Learning Takeaways

This application is currently an alpha prototype. This is the first Android application I have developed. Coming from a web-development background, I was really stretched with mobile development - a lot more than I had originally thought. The UI design was by far the hardest part for me as Android styling is all done through XML configuration files. 

The vehicle dropdown selection process also was interesting as I needed to hit an external API to load the information in the dropdown selects. Because web requests take some time 


## Future Plans
- Add full notification support for maintenance items
- Show maintenance in detail and allow completion/adding photos 
- Generate default maintenance tasks for specific makes/models 
- Convert to a customm API and move off of Firebase
